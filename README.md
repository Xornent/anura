THE PROJECT IS ARCHIEVED.

CURRENTLY NOT WORKING ON THE PROJECT. AS ABOUT 60% OF THIS PROJECT IS 
PART OF OTHER OPEN-SOURCE PROJECTS, WE KEEP THIS PROJECT ARCHIVED.

MY FURTHER STUDY OUTSIDE THE FIELD OF SOFTWARE ENGINEERING PREVENTS ME
FROM ACHIEVING THIS TIME-CONSUMING JOB (AND ALSO MACHANICAL WORK). I
DECIDE TO CHANGE TO SOME LIGHT-WEIGHT WHILE MORE SPECIALIZED WORK.

THANK YOU.
