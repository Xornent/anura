**[Status Notice]**: the project of this state is* **far from complete** , much of its functions and utilities was still **not implemented** , and that bugs remain unnoticed and unfixed. so please not try to fork and spread this inmature repos.

**[Internationalization Notice]**: *due to regional reasons and my lack in English knowledge, a full documentation and guideline in English prove too difficult. the contents of the project are mainly provided in Simplified Chinese.*
